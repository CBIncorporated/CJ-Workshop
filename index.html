  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    CJ Modifications is a game development and asset creation group specializing in FiveM and Roblox content, with a primary focus on high-quality, immersive FiveM MLOs (Map Location Overhauls). We cater to a wide range of roleplay communities, server owners, and developers who require professional-grade assets to enhance the gameplay experience on their platforms.Our journey began with a simple goal: to create unique, realistic environments that elevate the standard of in-game immersion. What started as a small project has evolved into a growing development hub trusted by server owners across various communities. We’ve built our reputation on consistency, attention to detail, and a commitment to delivering polished, functional content.
    At CJ Modifications, we understand the challenges server owners and developers face when looking for reliable, high-performance assets. That’s why we take a client-focused approach—offering direct communication, transparent timelines, and a consistent standard of quality.

    Our team is made up of developers and designers who not only understand the technical side of game development but also have hands-on experience with running and maintaining servers. This allows us to create with the end user in mind—ensuring compatibility, optimization, and usability from day one.

    Whether you're launching a new FiveM community, expanding a Roblox project, or simply looking for well-crafted assets to enhance your world, CJ Modifications is committed to helping you bring your ideas to life. We don’t just sell files—we help build experiences.
